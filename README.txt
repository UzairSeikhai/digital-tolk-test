Do at least ONE of the following tasks: refactor is mandatory. Write tests is optional, will be good bonus to see it. 
Upload your results to a Github repo, for easier sharing and reviewing.

Thank you and good luck!



Code to refactor
=================
1) app/Http/Controllers/BookingController.php
2) app/Repository/BookingRepository.php

Code to write tests (optional)
=====================
3) App/Helpers/TeHelper.php method willExpireAt
4) App/Repository/UserRepository.php, method createOrUpdate


----------------------------

What I expect in your repo:

X. A readme with:   Your thoughts about the code. What makes it amazing code. Or what makes it ok code. Or what makes it terrible code. How would you have done it. Thoughts on formatting, structure, logic.. The more details that you can provide about the code (what's terrible about it or/and what is good about it) the easier for us to assess your coding style, mentality etc

And 

Y.  Refactor it if you feel it needs refactoring. The more love you put into it. The easier for us to asses your thoughts, code principles etc


IMPORTANT: Make two commits. First commit with original code. Second with your refactor so we can easily trace changes. 


NB: you do not need to set up the code on local and make the web app run. It will not run as its not a complete web app. This is purely to assess you thoughts about code, formatting, logic etc


===== So expected output is a GitHub link with either =====

1. Readme described above (point X above) + refactored code 
OR
2. Readme described above (point X above) + refactored core + a unit test of the code that we have sent

Thank you!

My  thoughts about the code

Code Refactoring
================

1) BookingController.php
    What Makes the Code OK:
        Dependency Injection:
            The BookingRepository is injected into the controller via the constructor, adhering to dependency injection principles and promoting testability.
        
        Separation of Concerns:
            The controller delegates most of the logic to the repository, keeping it relatively lightweight and focused on request handling.
        
        Extensive Functionality:
            The controller covers a wide range of use cases, indicating that it serves as a central place for job-related operations.
        
        Use of Eloquent Models:
            Laravel's Eloquent ORM is used for database interactions, providing a clean and expressive syntax for queries.
        
    What Makes the Code Problematic:
        Lack of Validation:
            Request data is not validated before being passed to the repository methods. This could lead to unexpected behavior or errors when required fields are missing or malformed.
    
        Poor Method Naming:
            Methods like distanceFeed and immediateJobEmail are not self-explanatory. Names should be more descriptive to clarify their purpose.
    
        Inconsistent Response Formatting:
            Some methods return simple strings or arrays instead of consistently using response()->json(). This inconsistency can complicate debugging and integration.
    
        Code Duplication:
            Repeated patterns, such as checking user roles and handling request data, appear in multiple methods. This redundancy increases the maintenance burden.
    
        Overly Long Controller:
            The controller handles a large number of responsibilities, violating the Single Responsibility Principle. It acts as a monolithic entry point for all job-related logic instead of delegating concerns to specific services or handlers.
    
        Poorly Structured Logic:
            Nested if conditions, such as in distanceFeed, reduce readability. The method could be split into smaller, reusable parts.
    
    How I Would Have Done It or How can I make it done:
        Introduce Form Requests:
            Use Laravel's form requests to validate incoming data before it reaches the controller. This simplifies the controller logic and centralizes validation rules.
    
        Refactor Into Smaller Controllers:
            Break down the BookingController into smaller controllers or use route grouping with controller methods for specific concerns (e.g., JobController, NotificationController).
        
        Use a Service Layer:
            Delegate complex logic to a dedicated service class (e.g., JobService). This reduces the responsibilities of the controller and improves testability.
    
        Improve Naming Conventions:
            Use meaningful and descriptive method names. For example, rename distanceFeed to updateJobDistance.
    
        Simplify Responses:
            Standardize responses using JSON with consistent status codes and messages.
        
        Reduce Repetition:
            Extract common logic into helper methods or traits. For example, user role checks can be encapsulated in a single reusable method.
        
        Logging and Exception Handling:
            Add robust exception handling and logging to track errors and unexpected behavior.
    
    Thoughts on Formatting:
        PSR-12 Standards:
            Adhere to PHP-FIG's PSR-12 coding standards for consistent formatting and readability.
        
        Consistent Indentation and Spacing:
            Use consistent spacing around operators and within method bodies to improve visual clarity.
    
        What Makes the Code Amazing (Potentially):
            If refactored with the improvements above, this controller could serve as a clean and maintainable entry point for job-related functionality in the application. By leveraging Laravel's ecosystem effectively (form requests, services, traits), it could become a robust and scalable implementation.
2) BookingRepository.php
    Created BookingService which will apply business logic on the requested data and pass it to Repository, also doing refactoring on business logic moved from controller
